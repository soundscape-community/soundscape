# Soundscape Documentation Index

Use this index to find current operational docs versus historical planning logs.

## Current Operational Docs
- [Client overview entry point](./Client.md)
- [Services overview entry point](./Services.md)
- [iOS onboarding](./ios-client/onboarding.md)
- [iOS architecture overview](./ios-client/overview.md)
- [iOS testing](./ios-client/build-and-test/testing.md)

## Architecture and Component Deep Dives
- [`docs/ios-client/components/`](./ios-client/components/)
- [Data-plane schema notes](./services/data-plane-schema.md)

## Historical Planning Logs
- [Callout architecture modernization plan](./callout_architecture_plan.md)
- [Concurrency migration plan](./concurrency_migration_plan.md)

These historical planning docs are useful for context, but operational commands may drift. Prefer `AGENTS.md` and CI workflow files for current commands and defaults.
