# Plan Documentation Standards

Use `docs/plans/` for active, implementation-tracked plans.

## Required Structure
Each active plan document should include:
- Summary: goal and why it matters.
- Scope: what is in and out.
- Current status: concise state as of an explicit date.
- Progress updates: completed work (append-only log is fine).
- Next steps: ordered, concrete actions.

## Update Rules
- After implementation in a plan's scope, update that plan in the same change.
- Keep `Current status`, `Progress updates`, and `Next steps` accurate.
- Mark completed items clearly and add the next actionable items.
- Keep entries concise and decision-oriented.

## Naming
- Prefer `<topic>_plan.md` (example: `modularization_plan.md`).
- Keep one active plan per major initiative when possible.
