"faq.when_to_use_soundscape.answer" = "Soundscape has features and benefits that span a variety of scenarios and time scales. Furthermore, Soundscape’s value to you may evolve over time so how you use it today may differ from how you will use it in three months. People often think about apps in terms of \"what problem is this app good at solving?\" Soundscape certainly can be used on a case by case basis when you have a specific information need – such as keeping track of a destination as you make your way there, helping to orient yourself when you emerge from a metro station, getting your bearings when exiting a car, or finding the street names for, or distance to, the next intersection. However, the philosophy behind Soundscape is one of \"lighting up your world with sound\", designed to be used anytime you are out and about to provide ambient awareness of your surroundings, such as keeping you aware of the names of the streets you are on, the direction you are heading, and the names of businesses you are passing. In this use mode, our users have referred to Soundscape as a \"nice companion app\", which supports \"serendipity\", to \"fill in the gaps in your mental map\" and provide more \"confidence when walking\". Here are some other examples of how our users are incorporating Soundscape into their life:\n\n\"Soundscape helped me get back on track after I got off the bus and headed off in the wrong direction.\"\n\n\"Even in the town where I have lived for 3 years, I have built an improved picture of what is around me [with Soundscape].\"\n\n\"The 3D sound enhances my experience of a walk, as I feel more connected to my environment…I am more likely to try a new route now that I have the app to use.\"\n\n\"I miss the serendipity of walking around and noticing things. Having Soundscape is nice – it requires no effort to hear about things around me. The relational information is useful and is a great app for situational awareness and exploring commercial corridors.\"\n\n\"[I used Soundscape] to locate a pub in the middle of York. [I] used a range of its options to first locate and then actually find it. It took me to within 3 metres of the door – brilliant!\"";

From the location details screen you can select the \"Start Audio Beacon\" button. Tapping this will return you to the home screen and turn on an audible beacon coming from the direction of the place you've selected.

/*  */
"faq.how_to_use_beacon.answer" = "You can think of the audible beacon as a \"lighthouse for the ears\", notifying you of where your destination is relative to your location, as the crow flies. Like a lighthouse, it does not tell you how to get there – you may need to make many navigation choices along the way, just as a sailboat will have to make many strategic \"tacks\" to get closer to the lighthouse. The continuous rhythmic sound of the beacon is spatialised from the direction of the destination, and helps you stay aware of its location relative to you as you walk. When you are walking directly toward the destination, or you point the phone in that direction, a higher pitched \"ring\" sound will be heard. This feature allows you to pinpoint the direction of the destination since the direction of the rhythmic sound can sometimes be difficult to perceive in loud environments. When searching for the higher pitched \"ring\", hold the phone flat and sweep the phone slowly; turning your head to point in the same direction as the phone will ensure that you have the best spatial audio experience.\n\nThe lighthouse metaphor for the beacon’s design has several natural implications:\n\n1. There is no \"correct\" direction to travel when using the beacon, instead, with Soundscape you choose how to get there;\n2. The higher pitched \"ring\" helps you pinpoint the direction of the destination only – it is not an indication of how you should get there;\n3. If you generally know how to get to your destination, you may wish to mute the beacon for the majority of your trip and turn it on only as you get closer.";

Callouts will resume automatically when you approach the next intersection or point of interest, but the audible beacon will not. Select the \"unmute beacon button\" on the home screen to resume hearing the beacon.\n2. Stop automatic callouts: When you are not traveling or have reached a destination, you probably will not need Soundscape to continue to notify you of things around you. Instead of exiting the app, you can put Soundscape in Snooze mode and it will wake up again when you leave, or you can put Soundscape in Sleep mode and it will stay off until you wake it up. Alternatively, you can select \"Settings\" from the menu and choose to turn all callouts off in the \"Manage Callouts\" section.\n3. Stop the beacon: There are several scenarios for which you might set a destination, but not need the audible beacon on. For example, you may know exactly how to get to your destination, but you just want to get automatic updates about how far away you are. Or, you may know roughly how to get to your destination, and you only need the audio beacon when you're almost there.

Voice: You can choose which of the available voices on iOS you would like Soundscape to use, as well as the speed at which callouts are spoken. From the Menu, select \"Settings\" and then from \"General Settings\" select Voice to adjust the Speaking Rate and Voice settings. Additional voices, including enhanced quality voices, can be downloaded in the iOS Settings app at Settings > Accessibility > Spoken Content > Voices.\n2. Distance Metric: Soundscape allows you to hear all distances in either feet or metres. From the Menu, select \"Settings\" and then from \"General Settings\" select \"Language & Region\". The Units of Measure section allows you to toggle between two options: Imperial (feet) and Metric (metres).\n3. Markers: You can mark your world with anything you care about. You can mark things that are personal and relevant to you like your home, your office and your preferred grocery store. Then Soundscape will automatically call out marked places as you walk by or approach them, or you can also use the Nearby Markers button at the bottom of the home screen to hear a spatial callout of marked places around you. These markers will remain personal to you and will not be available to anyone else.\n\nIn addition to the above, the following VoiceOver settings can influence how Soundscape behaves:\n\n1. VoiceOver Tips: When VoiceOver tips are turned ON, you will hear more information about all the buttons on the primary Soundscape screen. You can turn on VoiceOver tips by navigating to the iOS Settings app and going to Accessibility > VoiceOver > Verbosity, and turning the Speak Hints setting on.\n2. Audio Ducking: Soundscape is designed to work with Audio Ducking turned OFF. When Audio Ducking is on, automatic callouts can be difficult to hear if VoiceOver is used simultaneously. We recommend turning Audio Ducking off to make it easier to hear all automatic callouts that occur as you are interacting with the phone. Audio ducking can be turned off in VoiceOver settings or via the VoiceOver rotor.\n3. Touch ID or Face ID to Unlock: Setting your phone to unlock using Touch ID or Face ID will make unlocking the phone fast and easy, and in turn, allow you to access the My Location, Around Me, and Ahead of Me buttons as quickly as possible when you are on the go. Set up Touch ID or Face ID unlocking in the iOS Settings app.";
