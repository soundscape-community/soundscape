# Soundscape Copilot Compatibility Shim

This repository uses `AGENTS.md` at the repository root as the canonical instruction source for coding agents.

If you are running in Copilot, follow `../AGENTS.md` for:
- architecture guidance,
- current build/test commands,
- documentation navigation,
- contribution hygiene.

This file is intentionally minimal to avoid drift between agent-specific instruction formats.
